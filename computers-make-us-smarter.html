			<h1>Remember When Computers Were Supposed to Make Us Smarter?</h1>
	<p class="init">Back in the late nineties and the early years of the following century, there seemed to be a general climate of optimism about the potential for computers and the internet to make us smarter and more thoughtful people. It would democratize access to the once scarce resources of culture&mdash;even a farm boy in rural Oklahoma would be able to listen to live performances of the London Symphony Orchestra, and have access to books unavailable in local libraries and book stores (if there were any to begin with). The internet became a haven for strange and wonderful things that were seemingly unsustainable in any other context</p>
	<p>My term for such things was the "weird web." Where else could you find a group of people exchanging <a href="http://www.alcuinus.net/GLL/">messages in Latin,</a> <a href="https://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/augustana.html">rich multilingual library,</a> a collection of literary works written according to the <a href="http://www.cadaeic.net/index.html"> digits of Pi,</a> clever puzzles inspired by a <a href="https://www.scarecrowsfield.com/">Pink Floyd hoax,</a> a series of <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">mathematical programming challenges,</a> and various other kinds of Borgesian weirdness. </p>
	<p>While some parts of the weird web have survived and flourished, others have passed away&mdash;such as the internet forums devoted to the great books that once flew under <i>The Jolly Roger</i>. Generally, however, the internet feels like a much less strange place these days. Once upon a time, the message of the internet was "Look&mdash;you're not the only one after all." Now, most things on the internet feel like they're pitched at the lowest common denominator, with everything driven by likes and algorithms. Where once upon a time the internet was to make us all little Captain Picards, asking our computers to play Vivaldi and teach us about alien cultures, we've become either something more tame and pedestrian, or sometimes like that creepy fellow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Pursuits">acting out his fantasies</a> on the Holodeck.
	<hr>
	<p class="init">Was it destined to be this way from the start? After all, the internet was initially just the sort of thing that appealed to the weird. The success of the popularizers&mdash;not just social media, but initially aggregators like AOL and Yahoo!&mdash;have made the entire affair more mainstream, diluting the once dominant offbeat element. </p>
	<p>But what still perhaps requires explanation is not just why the internet feels less weird overall, but why people are increasingly not even trying to do weird things with it. The drive of the lowest common denominator is not just dominant virtually universal.</p>
	<p>The explanation here probably lies in the shift toward the algorithmic. The internet now comes packaged with a goal, and that goal seems unfulfilled without a mass audience. How many can we reach with this tweet&mdash;how many subscribers will our video generate? The impetus to drive engagement through intense emotion (which has been memorably described as a cause of increasing <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/">structural stupidity</a> in our society) has also replaced the more cerebral appeals of the past.</p>
	<p>Another factor is undoubtedly the increasing bandwidth at our disposal. The limits of the early internet led to a bias towards what Postman described as the <em>typographical</em> culture, which tends to value nuance, thoughtfulness, and depth. But the ease of sharing images (particularly videos) has created a beachhead for the iconic, which has the opposite priorities of the sensational and discontinuous.</p>
	<hr>
	<p class="init">What are we who miss the weird web to do? I think the above analysis suggests a few imperatives. Let us deliberately pursue the minimalistic and the textual (as the spare design of this site is supposed to suggest) over the decorative and visual. Perhaps the hardest task will be to resist the relentless quantification of success. Can we any longer measure ourselves by a metric beyond likes, beyond a mass audience? Can we take pride in serving a few like-minded people well, rather than being the biggest and best? Do we dare any longer to be weird?</p>
